## PR Guidelines
* Keep it concise. A small, in-scope, easy to review pull request is always preferred over bulkier more complex ones. It's ok to split your work effort into more that one PR if you think it will make things easier on the reviewers.
* Provide a thorough description. Explain what your changes do in as simple terms as possible. Give examples of behavior or illustrate with images or diagrams.
* Don't rewrite Git history once other people have seen your PR. This is important for making sure reviewers have a clean picture of your changes.
* We don't enforce signed commits but many employers do so they know the PR came from you. Feel free to [setup signed commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) if you wish. 
* Don't merge someone elses PR unless asked to or the author is unavailable.
